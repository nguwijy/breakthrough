# breakthrough
This is my school project. It aims at creating an user interface and a computer player for a board game called [breakthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)). The AI was implemented by a brute force search over all possible moves, then [alpha-beta pruning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) was used for searching the best move efficiently.

## Usage
- clone the project
- make sure that in your matlab, the current folder is the folder that includes all .m and .png files
- run the BT.m file to execute the program
- click the "Help" button for the breakthrough game's rule
- enjoy the game!
